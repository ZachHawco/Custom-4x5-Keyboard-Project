This is the process of making my custom keyboard project. This repository also contains the software behind the keyboard.

# The start
This project started at the beginning of semester 2. I had originally bought 5 custom circuit boards to build a custom 4x10 keyboard for my school project in my computer engineering class. I only needed 2, the other 3 had just been sitting on my dresser with no purpose, just spare materials.

The 4x10 keyboard project went pretty well, but the whole thing could have been much more optimized, which is where my idea came in. I was going to build another keyboard, a 4x5 keyboard all by myself, no help involved. 

# Preparing

To start off, I needed some switches. My previous keyboard had used blue switches, so I wanted to experiement with red switches. I heard they sounded a lot smoother and had less response time than blue switches, so I bought a bunch off AliExpress for very cheap. Then, I came up with the idea of LEDs, which can be soldered to pads on the circuit board. I hadn't done anything related to soldering these kind of LEDs before, SK6812 mini-E RGB LEDs to be exact. My knowledge on how they worked was very little. So I did the same, I bought a bunch of them off AliExpress for very cheap. For this keyboard, I wanted a much better case than the previous one I designed for my school keyboard project, that one was very messy. The walls were WAY too thick, the hole at the bottom for the Arduino was uncentered with the actual Arduino, the switch holder wasn't very centered with the actual case and the bottom slab to cover the Arduino was hot glued on. The slab being hot clued on caused there to be a bit of room between the slab and the case itself, which looked pretty odd from the outside. I spent a lot of time learning about 3D designing, mainly, I leanred how to center objects when designing. This would help me with multiple things, I was able to perfectly shape the case so it perfectly fit around the switch holder. By learning about centering, I was able to properly center the hole in the case for the Arduino to be placed in. The case seemed VERY optimized, almost perfect. I had also learned about connectors in 3D designs. I wanted to have connectors on the bottom slab which would go into holes at the bottom of the case. My intention with this was so the slab would be attached to the case, no room in between, and would also be detachable rather than hot glued. I had been designing the case while I was waiting for the switches and LEDs
